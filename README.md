# ProbabilityTheoryGame
A probability theory game with prisoners based on a problem with 100 prisoners and 100 boxes.

About the game.

Imagine a prison in which there are 100 prisoners, each of which has its own serial number from 1 to 100.
These numbers were written on pieces of paper and randomly hidden in 100 numbered boxes placed in the room.
After that, each prisoner can only enter this room 1 time and find his number in no more than 50 attempts, opening different boxes.
As soon as the prisoner has found his room, he closes all the boxes and leaves, leaving everything as it was before his arrival. He is forbidden to communicate with other prisoners.
If all 100 prisoners find their serial numbers, the prison director will release them all, if at least one fails, they will all be executed.
